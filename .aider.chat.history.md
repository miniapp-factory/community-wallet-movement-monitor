App Name: Community Wallet Movement Monitor

Description:
Community Wallet Movement Monitor is a Mini App that tracks official community wallets of projects—DAO treasuries, grant wallets, ecosystem funds—and alerts users when significant transactions occur.

Key Features:
 • Real-time monitoring of DAO treasuries and community wallets
 • Alerts for large inflows, outflows, or fund reallocations
 • Multi-chain support for ecosystem wallets
 • Historical analysis of treasury behavior
 • Dashboard to follow multiple project wallets at once

Use Case:
Great for ecosystem observers, DAO members, and investors who want to understand how a project manages its funds and detect early signals of strategic moves.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve:

1. Updating the app metadata in **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** (title and description).  
2. Adding a new logo‑generation file **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo**.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact SEARCH/REPLACE block for it. Once that file is added, I’ll give you the blocks for both the metadata update and the new logo file.
